Here are notes about useful methods to work with paths, directories, and files. I keep searching for them all the time, so brief summary of what I usually need would be good.

### [System.IO.Path][1] class

Works on strings that represent logical path to file or a directory. Provides many useful static methods like

 - `Path.GetFullPath` - returns an absolute path from a relative path. Can work against both current directory or specified base path
 - `Path.Combine` - combines number of strings into a path
 - `Path.Exists` - checks existence of entity referenced by specified path
 - `Path.GetDirectoryName` - gets directory portion of the path
 - `Path.GetFileName` and `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` - get file name from the path
 - `Path.GetExtension` - returns file extension

### [System.IO.Directory][2] class

Static methods to work on directories like copying, moving, enumerating them.

I use the `Directory.EnumerateFiles` very often to find files across many input directories and their subdirectories:

```c#
foreach (string file in inputDirectories.SelectMany(
    dir => Directory.EnumerateFiles(dir, "*.xls*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)))
{
    ProcessFile(file);
}
```

Other useful methods are `EnumerateDirectories`, `Create`, `Delete`, `Exists`, or `Move`.  

### [System.IO.File][3] class

Many tools to work with files, from `Open`, `Exists`, `ReadAllLines`, `ReadAllText` to `Copy` and `Move`. 

Interesting functionality that can come handy on Windows platform that can use NTFS Encrypting File System (EFS) are methods `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` that provide protection that allow to decrypt only by same account who encrypted it.
