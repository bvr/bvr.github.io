This is an attempt to work a bit on my perspective. I used a book from [Mark Bergin - Jak kreslit auta, lodÄ›, letadla][1] (How to draw cars, ships and airplanes in translation). The drawing below is supposed to be [Aston Martin DBS][2], supersport car built in 2007, sporting 6 liter V12 engine with enough power to give it maximum speed over 300 kph.

The book gives you hints how to draw perspective box, outline basic shape of chassis and wheels, and incrementally build the details. I will try to continue drawing things like this and hopefully get better at it.
