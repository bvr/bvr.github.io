I got [this book][1] as a Christmas gift and finished it within few days. I don't have too much to compare against as it is just my second book from Jack Reacher universe. The other was [No Plan B][2] which caught my eye on an airport and I liked the style.

The narrative follows several people. There are two sisters that go after scientists connected to twenty years old secret project. There is Secretary of Defense, Charles Stamoran, who tries to protect the scientists and establishes a task force to find the murderers. The task force, put together from Army, CIA, FBI, and Treasury. They are trying to figure out the motives, connect the dots and protect those remaining.

The book is rather fast paced and short. As we are following all groups above, we are building better picture of what happened in winter 1969. It is easy read and quite entertaining. I only have some reservation to motives of some people - is it worth to kill several people because of injustice than happened twenty years ago when is not completely clear how they contributed to it? Also some minor characters really conduct rather mindlessly, losing track of people to get them found by Reacher in 30 seconds looking at a satellite photograph.

I liked the time spent with the book, although it did not leave deep tracks.
