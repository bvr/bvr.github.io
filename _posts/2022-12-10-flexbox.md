Notes working through the [Complete Guide to Flexbox][1] and [W3C Tests CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1][2] article.

 - flexbox was introduced around 2017
 - compatibility between browsers is pretty good
 - it can alter size of items in the container
 - is direction-agnostic

> Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
