At work we started using [CHANGELOG][1] along with [Semantic Versioning][2]. But the release notes are distributed with the installer of each tool and it used to be in RTF format. While [Markdown][3] is very nice textual format, our users usually don't have installed any editor for it, so distributing it as such is rather inconvenient.

So I was looking for a solution that would allow us to use the Markdown-based list of changes and still provide users with release notes as they are used to. Here is an example of the changelog file:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- v1.1 Brazilian Portuguese translation.
- v1.1 German Translation
- v1.1 Spanish translation.

### Changed

- Use frontmatter title & description in each language version template
- Replace broken OpenGraph image with an appropriately-sized Keep a Changelog 
  image that will render properly (although in English for all languages)

### Removed

- Trademark sign previously shown after the project description in version 
0.3.0

## [1.1.1] - 2023-03-05

### Added

- Arabic translation (#444).
- v1.1 French translation.
- v1.1 Dutch translation (#371).
- Centralize all links into `/data/links.json` so they can be updated easily.

### Fixed

- Improve French translation (#377).
- Improve id-ID translation (#416).
- Improve Persian translation (#457).

### Changed

- Upgrade dependencies: Ruby 3.2.1, Middleman, etc.

### Removed

- Unused normalize.css file.

There is wonderful tool to convert the [Markdown][3] into almost anything else - [pandoc][4]. You can build yourself a RTF with simple command line this:

```sh
pandoc CHANGELOG.md -s -o CHANGELOG.rtf
```

The type is detected from the suffix of the output option `-o` and `-s` specifies that the RTF should be standalone and contain all the setup and such.

Other option I wanted was to allow some portions of the file to be there for reference purpose, but not converted into the output. When I look for a solution, I found [this gist][5]. You can mark any heading with tag `noexport` like this:

```markdown
## Internal notes {.noexport}
```

Everything structurally under this heading will be ignored during the output, you just need to call the pandoc like this:

```sh
pandoc CHANGELOG.md --lua-filter=noexport-subtrees.lua -s -o CHANGELOG.rtf
```

It is also possible to change the output format with using of [Pandoc Templates][6]. Other option is to use the Word output format (that works for our users, too) and use reference document. You can output the document like this:

```sh
pandoc CHANGELOG.md --lua-filter=noexport-subtrees.lua -o CHANGELOG.docx
```

Then the document can be modified to your liking and used as reference like this:

```sh
pandoc CHANGELOG.md --lua-filter=noexport-subtrees.lua --reference-doc reference.docx -o CHANGELOG.docx
```

Styles and general formatting will be taken from the reference document, just the contents will come from the input [Markdown][3]. Overall the `pandoc` offers tons of options and I was very happy with my solution.
