I completed novel [Tai-Pan by James Clavell][1] that takes us to Hong Kong setting after the end of First Opium War in 1841. The area back then was barren, infertile rocky land that fallen into British hands after Treaty of Nanking and provided them with excellent port and land without mandarin interference.

The story revolves about colorful community of foreign people in China environment, far from their homes and with complicated relationships among them. Central characters of the book are Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock, owners and tai-pans of their trading companies. Their animosity influences much of their steps as well as their families.

Initial parts introduce many characters and watch them settling the Hong Kong's Happy Village. It also shows trading business, seamanship and organization of factories in Canton. Struan's company is then in grave danger of bankruptcy after successful run on bank where they have reserve money. At the last minute Dirk Struan is able to negotiate help by a loan from chinese Jin-Qua in return of promise of favors in form of four half-split coins. Every tai-pan of the Noble House, presented with the half-coin is required to grant whatever is asked.

Further story gives us complications of nineteenth century life, business, illness, dangers, stakes, love of Culum Struan (son of Dirk) and Tess Brock (daughter of Tyler Brock) and many other turns. Each character has own secrets, desires and dreams. The book is nicely told and it is great read.
