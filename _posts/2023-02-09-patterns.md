In C# 7 was introduced interesting operator `is` that allows to match (and also unpack) various types. In subsequent versions of the language its ability was greatly improved with many other patterns.

Basic idea is like this

```c#
if (obj is string)
    Console.WriteLine("obj is string");
```

It returns true if the supplied item is of specified type. That can be useful if we get an arbitrary object and we would like to detect if it has capabilities we need. At the same time, it can also provide cast to specified type. This is called **declaration and type pattern**.

```c#
if (input is string s)
    Console.WriteLine(s.ToLower());
```

Later there were introduced **constant**, **relational**, **positional** and **property** patterns. Also there is new `switch` expression that allows to pattern match against number of rules with nice checking that all options are properly exhausted

```c#
string DescribeStringLength(string str) => 
    str switch
    {
        null => "Null string",
        "Hello" => "Hello string",
        { Length: 0 } => "Empty string",
        { Length: 1 } => "Character",
        { Length: > 1 } => "Longer string",
    };
```

The example above shows checking against null, constant string and number of options in the `Length` property.
