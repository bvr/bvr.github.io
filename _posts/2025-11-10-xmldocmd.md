I wrote about [C# xml documentation comments][1] before. As we are using [Gitlab][2] for the workflow and documentation, I wanted to automatically generate markdown documentation for libraries and nuget packages.

Turns out there is several tools for this. After a trial and error I picked [XmlDocMarkdown][3].

The installation is rather simple

```
dotnet tool install xmldocmd -g
```

Then in your project run 

```
xmldocmd path_to_bin\library.dll doc
```

It generates a directory structure in `doc` directory with markdown files for the assembly, its namespaces, all classes and their members. It properly marks code blocks as C#, so they are nicely syntax-highlighted in Gitlab.
