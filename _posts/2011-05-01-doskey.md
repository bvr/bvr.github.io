## AutoRun

Here is how to setup what commands to run after **cmd.exe** runs.

To check what is currently setup there:

    reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun
    reg query "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun

To setup some command:

    reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d "prompt $$$S"
