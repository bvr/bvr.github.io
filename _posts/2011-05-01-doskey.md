Some notes on how to better utilize Windows command-line.

## AutoRun

Here is how to setup what commands to run after **cmd.exe** runs.

To check what is currently setup there:

    reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun
    reg query "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun

An example to set command prompt to `$ `:

    reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d "prompt $$$S"

or set the prompt to yellow color ([the guide for esc codes][1]):

    reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d "prompt $e[93m$P$G$e[0m"

## Pager

Many commands can benefit from setting `PAGER` variable to something more elaborate than `more` command. I have it
set to `less -S`, where less is [windows port of linux less command][3]. It allows to scroll back and forth all the 
contents, search in it and many other useful commands.

When installed, run

    less --help

to see all instructions and options.
