As I am learning more python, I run across common pattern in sample code. It looks like this and it is very common 

```python
def main():
    print("Let's go")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

looking for sources on internet I found [this article][1]. It is quite simple, the idiom allows to have script that can be imported without running the `main` function, but run it when started as a script. In essence this is very similar to [Modulino][3] concept I already saw in perl world.

More description can be found in [official documentation][2]. In short, the `__name__` contains current environment. Top level scripts or modules called `-m` have special string `__main__` in the variable, otherwise there is name of current module.

Quick demonstration, let's have a module `blem`

```python
print(f"Module: {__name__}")
```

and a script loading it

```python
import blem
print(f"Script: {__name__}")
```

This outputs

```
Module: blem
Script: __main__
```
