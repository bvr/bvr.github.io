**Small Things Like These** is a short novel by **Claire Keegan**, set in a small Irish town in the 1980s. It follows Bill Furlong, a coal and timber merchant, during the weeks leading up to Christmas.

Bill was raised by a single mother who worked as a servant for a wealthy widow. Thanks to the widow's kindness, he had a stable childhood despite the town's social problems. Now a hardworking businessman, he lives with his wife Eileen and their five daughters.

During a routine coal delivery to the local convent, Bill makes a disturbing discovery â€” a young girl locked in a shed, cold and neglected. The convent, run by nuns, is known for taking in "fallen" girls, but rumors of mistreatment have long circulated in the town. The girl's situation reminds Bill of his own past, forcing him to confront difficult truths about his town, his childhood, and his own moral choices.

The novel focuses on themes of community, silence, and personal responsibility. Bill struggles with whether to speak up or ignore what he has seen, knowing that taking action could have serious consequences for his family and business.

Author's writing is quiet and atmospheric, with a slow pace. The story builds toward a moment of quiet defiance, leaving the reader to reflect on the weight of small acts of courage.

A short but powerful read, **Small Things Like These** greatly capture the tension between morality and social conformity. It was also first time I learned about [Magdalene laundries][1] and their history.
