My wife recently brought home a comic book **47 Ronin** by **Mike Richardson** and **Stan Sakai**. It is a retelling of one of Japan's most famous samurai legends.

The story starts in Sengakuji Temple. A samurai comes to light a candle on grave of Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio. He tells a story to monk who comes to comfort him.

The story begins with Lord Asano, who is provoked by the corrupt court official Kira. Unable to bear the insults, Asano attacks him inside the shogun's palace, which is a grave crime. For this, Asano is ordered to commit seppuku, and his lands are confiscated. His loyal retainers suddenly become masterless samurai — ronin.

Among them is Ōishi, Asano's chief counselor, who becomes the leader of the group. While Kira grows more arrogant and secure, Ōishi plays the long game. He pretends to fall into a life of drinking and shame to make Kira believe he has lost all honor. In secret, however, he and the other ronin are preparing for revenge.

After nearly two years of waiting, the 47 ronin launch their night attack on Kira's mansion in Edo. They fight their way through his guards, find Kira hiding, and kill him to avenge their master. They then march to Asano's grave and place Kira's head before it, fulfilling their duty.

The shogun recognizes their loyalty but cannot ignore the law. The ronin are ordered to commit seppuku, which they accept as the honorable end of their mission. They are buried together near their lord, and their story becomes a symbol of loyalty, justice, and sacrifice in Japanese culture.

The samurai at Sengakuji resented Ōishi's pretended behavior and spit on his drunken body. Now he feels guilt and when monk leaves he commits seppuku on his grave.

For me, the book was beautiful, tragic, and difficult to understand — the japanese culture and its  code of honor is rather conflicting with my culture beliefs. It is still interesting to see it in effect and think about how it could form the people and their behavior.
