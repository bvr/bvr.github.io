How to get going with F# scripting in VSCode editor. As I was looking for some guide on setting it up, I found this  [talk at youtube][1]. Here are some notes from watching it.

In order to use [Ionide plugin][2] in VSCode, .net Core of some version have to be installed. Quick check on what version is currently installed:

```
dotnet --info
```

Once **Ionide** is enabled, it helps with editing of the code. Few useful features:

 - when breadcrumb is enabled `View: Toggle Breadcrumbs`, it shows code structure and allows to move to the items in the file
 - with Alt+Enter, the selected code can be sent into the F# Interactive window
 - provides F# help for cursor element with `F#: Open Info Panel`
 - refactoring tools: Rename Symbol, Find References, etc

Also used in the video, [BenchmarkDotNet][3] library, and use of `BenchmarkRunner` class.
