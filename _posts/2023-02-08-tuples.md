Tuple is lightweight data structure to put together some heterogenous items. Original ways to create them with old C# was something like this

```c#
var tuple = Tuple.Create(1, "Hello", 3);
Console.WriteLine(tuple);
Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item1);
```

One problem was that all items of the tuple were called `ItemNNN` and it was hard to deduce what you stored there in the first place. In C# 7 there were introduced names to tuple items. There are two ways to build them

```c#
var tuple2 = (Number: 1, Name: "Hello", Count: 3);
```

Or with explicitly specified type

```c#
(int Number, string Name, int Count) tuple3 = (1, "Hello", 3);
```

Named tuples are value type (contrary to original `System.Tuple`) and they support equality, which compares all items sequentially without considering item name. The tuple is also easy to print and easy to hash, since they have sensible built-in methods available for both.

Usage is simple

```c#
Console.WriteLine(tuple2);          // (1, Hello, 3)
Console.WriteLine(tuple2.Number);   // 1
Console.WriteLine(tuple2.Name);     // Hello
Console.WriteLine(tuple2.Count);    // 3
Console.WriteLine($"{tuple2} and {tuple3} are " + (tuple2 == tuple3 ? "the same" : "different"));
                                    // (1, Hello, 3) and (1, Hello, 3) are the same
```

It is also possible to deconstruct the type into individual fields

```c#
(int num, string name, int count) = tuple3;
```
