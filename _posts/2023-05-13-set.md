The [set][1] is one of most powerful concepts in python. I recently watched following video

<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGAngdU_8D8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Slides are available at [speakerdeck][4]. Here are my notes from the watching

 - the set is not mere container for unique elements
 - there is many powerful operations working over whole sets 
   - intersection works similarly to `and`, operator `&` in python
   - union is basically `or`, operator `|` in python
   - symmetric difference compares to `xor`, items in each sets, but not both, operator `^` in python
   - difference - things in first that are not in second, operator `-` in python
 - way to build set from series - set comprehension
 - `set` constructor from any iterable
 - `in` operator is very fast (set is implemented as hash table)
 - subset and superset comparisons with `>=` operators
 - update methods (`update` add items from iterable, `intersection_update` intersects with iterable)
 - the interface is defined in [collections.abc][2], most of set operations are defined there
 - praise for the book [Go Programming Language][3] by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan
 - demonstration of writing alternate set of unsigned integers, available on [github][5]
