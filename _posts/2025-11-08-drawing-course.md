After some contemplating I decided to attend a [sketching course][1]. It was quite an interesting experience, with a different kind of people than I usually meet with. I was also provided with three hours of uninterrupted time to work on a drawing, something I had never done before.

We got an explanation of **hatching** basics, ways to show space and light tones that together make the shape of an item. We also learned the [graphite grading scale][2], were provided with pencils

- `HB` for basic shape
- `2H` for light hatching
- `3B` for dark hatching

The first image I tried was a cup with some shading. It was made from a picture, so it was much easier to see and copy shades, the styles of hatching and the overall shape.

Another attempt was a little more complicated. The lecturer provided us with a glass placed on a box with some papers around for the background and a light source. We tried to see all the shades and put them on paper again with a pencil. 

We also learned some extra tricks. If you squint, you can see the light and dark areas much better and more easily distinguish between them. We also learned how to [measure the object with pencil in straight hand][3] to get the proportions right. Here are my two attempts to capture it.

The last project was to draw something with black ink. I selected a picture of an F-15 Eagle, something [I tried before][4]. This time I did not use any grid to help with proportions, I just captured a few basic lines, extended them to a full shape with a pencil and then used ink to get the shape and hatching to show the light and darkness.

I was quite impressed by the amount of time spent on those projects and the whole environment. I guess this is not the last time I tried that.
