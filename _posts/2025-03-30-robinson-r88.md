Recently there was a new addition to Robinson small helicopter family, the [R88][1]. Building on successful turbine-powered model [R66][2], the all new, significantly larger airframe was presented with cabin for eight passengers and two pilots. 

I really like its design, so I decided to brush my drawing skills a bit and came with this picture.

Hope I can see it someday on an airshow.
