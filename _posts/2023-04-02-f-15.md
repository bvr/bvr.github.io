[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle][1] is one of most successful fighter design ever produced. Started as reaction on expected performance of MiG-25, it quickly surpassed most of contemporary contenders. It first flew 50 years ago, in 1972 and it is still in service in several major air forces - US, Japan, Saudi, and Israeli AF. 

I am still trying of pencil representation of photos [using a grid]({% post_url 2023-02-19-air-tractor %}) mentioned in one of previous posts.
