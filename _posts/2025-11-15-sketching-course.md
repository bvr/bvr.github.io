Since the last [Sketching course][1] was pretty good, I went there again the another week.

This time there was different lecturer. She quickly explained the sketching as a fast attempt to capture essence of an object, with markers and quick straight lines. We got a lot of samples and tried to initially get our hands loose by painting many simple pictures.

When the paper was full, she quickly pointed some tips, and we discussed proportions, shapes, hatching styles and other options we could apply to the drawing. Nice touch was that with marker you are not tempted to fix anything, you just try to capture the object and move on.

The other set included some other shading styles and also some attempts to capture the volume of the objects. 

Once we were done with those, we moved to objects of our choice. I tried to draw some animals, first the simple shape of a sitting dog from a few lines. Most of the sketches were made with a pencil, but I also tried a charcoal stick for a bolder shape.

Further drawings tried to capture the shape of dogs and a simplified human body. It can be very useful to express motion of people. A very basic approach is a human shape from six ovals. It is pretty simple, but when you want to show movement, the ovals need to be bent to properly express the position. Then there was a more advanced shape from twelve ovals, where bending can be done just by their positioning.

Then I tried something else - a bear drawn with just charcoal. It is rather interesting, since the picture is not made as much from lines as from areas that represent shades and light.

This time I tried a number of other techniques. I consider this time very well spent and I am looking forward to another lesson.
