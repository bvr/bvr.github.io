Since the last [Sketching course][1] was pretty good, I went there another week, too.

This time there was different lecturer. She quickly explained the sketching as a fast attempt to capture essence of an object, with markers and quick straight lines. We got a lot of samples and tried initially get our hands loose with painting many simple pictures.

When the paper was full, she quickly pointed some tips, we discussed proportions, shapes, hatching styles and other options we could apply to the drawing. Nice touch was that with marker you are not tempted to fix anything, you just try to capture the object and move on.

Other set included some other shading styles and also some attempts to capture volume of the objects. 

Once we were done with those, we move to objects of our choice. I tried to draw some animals, first the simple shape of sitting dog from few lines. Most of the sketches were made with a pencil, but I also tried charcoal stick for bolder shape.

Further drawings tried to capture shape of dogs and simplified human body. It can be very useful to express motion of people. Very basic is human shape from six ovals. It is pretty simple, but when you want to show a movement of them, the ovals needs to be bent to properly express the position. Then there was more advanced shape from twelve ovals, where bending can be done with just their positioning.

Then I tried something else - bear drawn with just charcoal. It is rather interesting, since the picture is not made as much from lines as from areas that represent shades and light.

This time I tried number of other techniques. I consider this time very well spent and I am looking for another lesson.
