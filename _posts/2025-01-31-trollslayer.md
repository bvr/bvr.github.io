On a recommendation of a friend I got into Gotrek and Felix fantasy series from Warhammer universe written by William King. The universe was created for desk and online games. 

The **Trollslayer** is first book of the series. It is played in the world that resembles medieval times with towns, castles, and villages. Multiple races lives there, with elders like dwarfs and elves currently in a decline from their former powerful status. Other races are Mankind, Skaven (rat people), Orcs, Goblins, or Undead. Major conflict is between forces of Order and Chaos.

The first book was originally written as set of stories to be published in magazines. It follows Gotrek Gurnisson, the dwarf trollslayer seeking heroic death, and Felix Jaeger, human poet and fencer that is tied by oath to follow him and write about his end. 

The storytelling is fast and raw, with characters getting into troubles quite fast. Following chapters form the book:

 - Geheimnisnacht (Night of Secrets)
 - Wolf Riders
 - The Dark Beneath the World
 - The Mark of Slaanesh
 - Blood and Darkness
 - The Mutant Master
 - Ulric's Children

It briefly and in retrospective covers how they met and ended up with the oath. We soon encounter Chaos forces, mostly mutants, priests, evil sorcerers, and undead creatures. In Wolf Riders we meet Felix's love Kirsten and cursed von Diehl family trying to flee to the Border lands. His love is unfortunately killed during a final fight.

The Dark Beneath the World takes us to ruined city Karak Eight Peaks. They join forces with Templar of Fiery Heart, seeking for lost sword Karaghul. During exploration of tunnels under the city they discover Great Tomb and the sword in it. A huge mutant troll shows up and kill templars. With great luck, Felix sets the troll on fire which allows Gotrek to finally kill him. The sword Karaghul remains in possession of Felix until he is able to return it back to the templars.

Other chapters build on the clashes with forces of Chaos, namely champion Justine leading horde of mutants in Blood and Darkness, Albericht Kruger the sorcerer in The Mutant Master, and fighting with werewolves against Count Hrothgar in Ulric's Children.

The book was in Czech language with quick and easy read. Nothing very profound, but nice relaxing material.
