For a long time, this site lacked a favicon, making it difficult to locate its pages in my browser. I wanted a simple solution that could create all necessary image sizes without requiring too much time or effort.

After some googling I came across the [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) and its [Text to Ico](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) feature. You simply need to choose the following:

 - Text (including Unicode characters)
 - Shape (circle, rounded square, square)
 - Font and its size
 - Color and background color

The result can be seen on this site, and it took me only about five minutes to create.
