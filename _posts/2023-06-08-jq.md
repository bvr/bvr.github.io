We have a web tool for [earned value management][3] of internal projects. It is written in ASP.NET MVC and it also provides nice JSON API to retrieve data. 

There is tasks url that returns all available tasks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "Id": 1,
    ...
    "Assignee": "Milan Bartl",
    "Name": "Helper 1.0.0",  
    "Predicted Start": "6/1/2021",
    "Predicted End": "8/31/2022",
    "Completed": "8/22/2022",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Id": 2,
    ...
    "Assignee": "Roman Hubacek",    
    "Name": "VM - Migration",
    "Predicted Start": "9/30/2022",
    "Predicted End": "10/31/2022",
    "Completed": "10/17/2022",
    ...    
  }          
  ...
]
```

I can obtain such information with command-line tools like [curl][4] and then apply filtering on the data using [jq][1]. For example

```
curl https://projects/api/tasks | jq ".[] | select(.Assignee == \"Roman Hubacek\" and .\"Team Tracker\" == \"2023 Tools milestones\")
```

The filter above picks all entries in the top-level array and filter out only my tasks for current year. The filters can be nicely chained, by adding 

```
| [ .Name, .\"Predicted End\", .Completed ]
```

I got only fields I am interested in as an array of arrays. This form can be also nicely formatted into `csv` with handy `@csv` filter. It did not occurred before to me that JSON can be processed easily from command line, but it works quite well.
