We have a web tool for [earned value management][3] of internal projects. It is written in ASP.NET MVC and it also provides nice JSON API to retrieve data.

There is tasks url that returns all available tasks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "Id": 1,
    ...
    "Assignee": "Joe Smith",
    "Name": "Helper 1.0.0",
    "Predicted Start": "6/1/2021",
    "Predicted End": "8/31/2022",
    "Completed": "8/22/2022",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Id": 2,
    ...
    "Assignee": "Roman Hubacek",
    "Name": "VM - Migration",
    "Predicted Start": "9/30/2022",
    "Predicted End": "10/31/2022",
    "Completed": "10/17/2022",
    ...
  }
  ...
]
```

I can obtain such information with command-line tools like [curl][4] and then apply filtering on the data using [jq][1]. For example

```
curl https://projects/api/tasks | jq ".[] | select(.Assignee == \"Roman Hubacek\" and .\"Team Tracker\" == \"2023 Tools milestones\")
```

The filter above picks all entries in the top-level array and filter out only my tasks for current year. The filters can be nicely chained, by adding

```
| [ .Name, .\"Predicted End\", .Completed ]
```

I got only fields I am interested in as an array of arrays. This form can be also nicely formatted into `csv` with handy `@csv` filter. In that case it is useful to put in the `-r` option that outputs raw strings and does not escape each entry. We might also want to add a verbatim header

Altogether the command line is

```
curl https://projects/api/tasks | jq -r "([\"Name\",\"Predicted End\", \"Completed\"] | @csv), (.[] | select(.Assignee == \"Roman Hubacek\" and .\"Team Tracker\" == \"2023 Tools milestones\") | [ .Name, .\"Predicted End\", .Completed ] | @csv)"
```

Result is following table

| Name        | Predicted End | Completed |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Milestone 1 | 6/16/2023     | 6/22/2023 |
| Milestone 2 | 7/31/2023     |           |
| Milestone 3 | 4/17/2023     | 4/19/2023 |
| Milestone 4 | 3/3/2023      |           |
| Milestone 5 | 6/30/2023     | 3/13/2023 |
| Milestone 6 | 2/3/2023      | 2/3/2023  |
| Milestone 7 | 1/20/2023     | 1/19/2023 |
| Milestone 8 | 6/30/2023     |           |

It did not occurred before to me that JSON can be processed this easily from command line, but it works quite well.
