My HTML/CSS skills are very dated, haven't done much coding lately. And those exceptions I needed to do at work I was able to work-around with frameworks like [bootstrap][1]. So the things like flexbox or [grid][3] mostly escaped my attention.

As I wanted to get familiar with this, I walked through following video, rewriting the CSS using [Tailwind][2] helpers.

<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9rHsdCxU8Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

What I learned:

 - the grid allows easy definition of something like table layout
 - a HTML element is marked as `grid`, it area is split into grid according to a `grid-cols-` and `grid-rows-` utilities. Tailwind provides uniform distribution for up to 12 rows or columns. Custom definitions can be added into `tailwind.config.js`, it can be then used with `grid-cols-layout` and `grid-rows-layout` respectively
```js
    ...
    theme: {
      extend: {
        gridTemplateRows: {
          'layout' : '50px 1fr 100px',
        },
        gridTemplateColumns: {
          'layout' : '300px 1fr',
        }
      },
    ...
```
 - there is utility to control gap between the grid items `gap-`
 - embedded HTML elements are then placed regularly, but it can be easily defined to "span" across more grid cells using `row-start-` and `row-end-` utilities (or `col-start-` and `col-end-` for columns). The number refer to grid lines
 - alternative means to specifying the grid lines is `row-span-` and `col-span-` utilities

Resulting HTML was like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
<div class="w-screen h-screen grid grid-cols-layout grid-rows-layout gap-0">
  <div class="col-start-1 col-end-4 p-2">Header</div>
  <div class="p-2 hidden lg:block">Sidebar</div>
  <div id="maintext" class="row-start-2 row-end-3 col-start-1 lg:col-start-2 col-end-4 p-2 overflow-auto min-w-30">Main Text</div>
  <div class="col-span-3 p-2">This is a footer</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

There is more to the properties and options provided by the grid, but I got a basic overview of what it does and how it works.
